|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Everyone knows what to do                    | Can get chaotic fast                                                              |
| You can pivot/iterate (start of sprint)      | Hard to see how far along a task is                                               |
| Able to test and document the team‚Äôs ability | Hard to see the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù if everything is split up                           |
| Splitting up tasks makes it more manageable  | Hard to pivot mid-sprint                                                          |
| Involves good communication                  | Can bloat the complexity of relatively small tasks                                |
| Has a ‚Äúdefinition of done‚Äù                   | Can feel like micromanagement                                                     |
|                                              | Involves a lot of meetings                                                        |
|                                              | Doesn‚Äôt take the entire (budget) project into account as it is split into sprints |
|                                              | The ‚Äúdefinition of done‚Äù can be counterproductive                                 |

| **+ (positive)**                                              | **- (negative)**                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Respects the deadlines                                        | Kills the iterative process              |
| Very clear process                                            | Could involve a lot of assumptions       |
| You don‚Äôt have to stress over the iterative process           | What do you do when it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot your turn‚Äù |
| It breaks a bigger deadline into smaller ones                 | Prone to human error                     |
| It stops people from going back or becoming too perfectionist |                                          |
| Works when you already have a successful product              |                                          |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### **Scope Creep**
- Unplanned feature additions disrupt timelines and budgets.
- Solutions:
  - Plan thorough prototyping.
  - Add buffer time.
  - Use change requests.
  - Swap features or defer to updates.

### **Change Requests**
- Formal process for proposing changes.
- Encourages accountability and documentation.

**Pros**: Organized, transparent.  
**Cons**: Adds bureaucracy, may discourage ideas.

### **Technical Debt**
- **Intentional**: Prioritizing polish over new features.
- **Unintentional**: Quick fixes that cause future issues.

**Solutions**:
- Clear feature definitions.
- Technical documentation.
- Budget for refactoring.
- Avoid debt in production phase.

## üõ†Ô∏è PM Best Practices

### **Sprint Planning**
- Estimate hours and assign tasks logically.
- Don‚Äôt force estimates to fit time.

### **Kanban**
- One task per person in progress.
- Manage review queues and unfinished tasks.

### **Stand-Up**
- Keep short and focused.
- Plan follow-ups for deeper discussions.

### **Sprint Review**
- Reflect on process.
- Encourage feedback: start, keep, stop doing.

## üìö Glossary Highlights
- **Onboarding**: Introducing new team members.
- **Technical Debt**: Future workload from shortcuts.
- **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled project growth.
- **Change Requests**: Formal change proposals.
- **Dependencies**: Task prerequisites.
