# 📣 Marketing & Stores – Summary

## 🧭 The Four P’s of Marketing
1. **Product** – What is it? Who needs it? Why? How does it stand alone?
2. **Price** – Balance between perceived value and real cost. Includes discounts, EULA, and market fit.
3. **Place** – Where and how the game is distributed and marketed (e.g., Steam, Xbox, Reddit, Meta).
4. **Promotion** – Public-facing marketing: tone, message, PR, and advertising.

## 🧑‍💼 Working with Game Marketeers
- Expensive but valuable for their **network** (press, publishers, influencers).
- Services include content creation, community management, and campaign planning.
- Not always full-service; often genre/platform-specific.
- Best used when the game is near completion or has funding.

## 📝 Step-by-Step Indie Marketing

### **Step 1: Marketing Plan**
- Define budget, actions, tone, and calendar.
- Plan marketing beats (e.g., Steam Next Fest).

### **Step 2: Workflow**
- Assign roles: artists, producers, designers, devs, editors, writers.
- Treat marketing as a parallel project with its own producer.

### **Step 3: Fail and Retry**
- Expect failure; use **A/B testing** to compare strategies.
- Focus on **conversion rates** (e.g., wishlist % from page views).

### **Step 4: When to Announce**
- Options: early concept, MVP, or finished game.
- Consider Steam wishlist goals (e.g., 40K for PVP games).
- Avoid overreacting to early feedback—stay the course.

## 🎬 Trailer-First Approach
- Create a trailer before the game (e.g., Darkest Dungeon).
- **Pros**: Market testing, no overhead, marketing-first mindset.
- **Cons**: Hard to gauge success, not ideal for sequels or new devs.

## 📺 Social Media & Devlogs
- Share your journey on YouTube, Twitch, etc.
- Helps build community but is time-consuming.
- Find your niche to stand out.

## 🛍️ Store Page Optimization
- Focus on Steam page visuals, layout, and messaging.
- Use tools and guides to improve visibility and conversion.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Don’t copy AAA marketing blindly—focus on AA and high-quality indie examples.
- AAA studios have resources to fail; indies must be more strategic and creative.
- Marketing is about increasing odds, not guaranteeing success.
