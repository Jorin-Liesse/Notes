# 🎮 The Game Life Cycle

## 📌 Core Stages of Game Development
1. **Preproduction** – Planning, ideation, prototyping.
2. **Production** – Full development, asset creation, coding.
3. **Postproduction** – Release, live ops, maintenance.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem in Game Development
- 19,000+ games released on Steam in 2024; 80% went mostly unplayed.
- Many devs release only one game due to burnout, bankruptcy, or poor planning.
- The goal: avoid poor production cycles and build sustainable practices.

---

## ✅ The Solution
- Don’t reinvent the wheel—refine proven methods.
- Learn from industry veterans like Hidetaka Miyazaki, Swen Vincke, and Will Wright.
- Develop a personalized, effective production process.

---

## 🧠 Planning Phase
- Focus on resources, budget, and scope—not just game content.
- Use the **MoSCoW method**:
  - **Must have**
  - **Should have**
  - **Could have**
  - **Won’t have**
- Assign roles, identify missing skills, and prepare the team.

---

## 🧪 Preproduction Phase
- **Ideation**: Brainstorming, concept art, mockups.
- **Documentation**:
  - Art Bible
  - Tech Document
  - Game Design Document
  - Project Wiki
- **Department Roles**:
  - **Art**: Style exploration, references.
  - **Design**: Mechanics, paper prototypes.
  - **Coding**: Feasibility, engine selection, digital prototypes.

---

## 🧩 Prototypes & Demos
- **Prototype**: Tests multiple mechanics.
- **Proof of Concept**: Validates one idea or mechanic.
- **Vertical Slice**: Polished, playable section of the game.
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Basic, sellable version of the game.

## 🛠️ Production Phases

### **Pre-Alpha**
- Core mechanics implemented.
- Teamwork and documentation are crucial.
- Sets the tone for the rest of development.

### **Alpha 1.0**
- All planned features implemented.
- Bugs and polish issues remain.
- Ready for internal critique.

### **Late Alpha**
- Feature-complete and fun.
- Final tweaks, polish, and user data collection.

### **Beta**
- Sent to QA for testing.
- Major bug fixing and polish.

### **Gold**
- Final release candidate.
- Uploaded to storefronts.
- Day-one patches and updates prepared.

---

## 🌐 Live Ops & Maintenance

### **Live Ops**
- Ongoing updates, events, and community management.
- Common in games like LoL, WoW, Overwatch.

### **Maintenance**
- Final phase: servers stay up, but no new content.
- Includes patches, balancing, and porting.

---

## 🧪 Early Access (EA)
- Launching MVP early to gather feedback and funding.
- Risks: poor communication, underestimated workload, unmet expectations.
